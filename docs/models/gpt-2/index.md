# GPT-2

Generate text based using the [GPT-2 algorithm](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).

After launching this model you will get an endpoint to easily generate text based on an input.

Features:

- The largest available GPT-2 model with 1.5 billion parameters
- State of the art results on text generation
- Easy parameters that allows for easy exploration of the results
- Same low price independent of the resources used (`memory/cpu/gpu`)

See how to [launch this algorithm in AWS SageMaker](/models/gpt-2/getting-started)
and [examples](/models/gpt-2/examples).

## Pricing

This model has a fee of `0.15` dollars per hour.
You will incur costs for software use **only** for as long as your endpoint is running.

Infrastructure costs are independent and in addition to the costs of software
and it depends on the instance type selectd.
