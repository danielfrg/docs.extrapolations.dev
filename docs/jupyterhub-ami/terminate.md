# Terminate your subscription

You can terminate your subscription by simply terminating the EC2 instance.
You will no longer be charged by EC2 usage or the AMI fee until you start it again.

You can also manage you AWS subscriptions from this page: [Subcriptions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/home/subscriptions?#/subscriptions).
