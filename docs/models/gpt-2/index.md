# GPT-2

Generate text based using the [GPT-2 algorithm](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/).

After launching this model you will get an endpoint to easily generate text based on an input.

Features:

- The largest available GPT-2 model with 1.5 billion parameters
- State of the art results on the following tasks:
    - Text generation
    - Reading Comprehension / Get answers from questions
    - Summary Generation
    - Translation
- Easy parameters that allows for easy exploration of the results
- Same low price independent of the resources used (`memory/cpu/gpu`)

See how to [launch this algorithm in AWS SageMaker](/models/gpt-2/getting-started)
and [examples](/models/gpt-2/examples)


## Costs

You have selected a real-time inference configuration. You will incur costs for software use based on hourly pricing as long as your endpoint is running.

Infrastructure costs are independent and in addition to the costs of software.
